I'm taking the JavaScript30 course. I've seen several recommendations for [this](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) challenge by Wes Bos, but it was [Kent C Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) whose recommendation finally pushed me to sign up and check it out.

I'm going to keep diary here of the concepts I'm exposed to each day. After I finish, I'll provide a **brief** writeup on my thoughts.

Hopefully this will be a good article for people who are curious about what the experience is like or working along and want to compare notes.

#### Day 1: JavaScript Drum Kit

Concepts:

- key events ([these](http://keycode.info/))
- Web Audio API ([this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API))
- Listener for ```trasitionend``` event (CSS transitions)
- data attributes

Thoughts:

That took more time than I'd have liked. I've never used the Web Audio API, so I had to read quite a bit to find the documentation for available methods. I like the way he snuck in ```el.classList``` property. That's a great jQuery alternative.

#### Day 2: CSS + JS Clock

Concepts:

- ```transform-origin``` (CSS)
- ```transition-timing-function``` (the easing curve can be shaped manually in Chrome DevTools!)
- ```setInterval()```
- ```Date()```

Thoughts:

Okay. This is a very well-designed course. I honestly learned more about CSS than JS with this one, because I've used the ```setInterval()``` and ```Date()``` plenty, but I've never used the transform and transition properties to achieve the effect of clock hands spinning.

#### Day 3: Playing with CSS Variables and JS

Concepts:

- CSS Variables
- NodeList ([this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList), which has a different prototype from standard arrays)
- dataset property in NodeList prototype (to access [data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes))

Thoughts:

Again, I feel like I'm learning more about CSS than I expected, but I'm not complaining. This is awesome. I did not know that CSS had native variables yet. But it does, and unlike precompiled styling (Sass, etc.) they can be updated dynamically by JavaScript... in runtime!

#### Day 4: Array Cardio 1

Concepts:

- ```map()```
- ```reduce()```
- ```filter()```
- ```sort()```
- ```console.table()```

Thoughts:

I've mentioned the last few days have been CSS heavy, not the case today. While I'm familiar with all these array functions, it's always fun to get another chance to use them. The one I've probably used the least is sort.

#### Day 5: Flex Panels Image Gallery

Concepts:

- flex (css)
- event-driven class toggle
- ```transform: translate()```
- cubic-bezier


Thoughts:

Very cool exercise. I really enjoy the ones like these that touch on event-driven transitions and animations via class toggle. It's such a common pattern, but the possibilities for creative interactivity are endless. I didn't learn many new concepts per se, but it was a very creative and unique idea.

Stay tuned...
