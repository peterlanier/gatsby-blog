I'm taking the JavaScript30 course. I've seen several recommendations for [this](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) challenge by Wes Bos, but it was [Kent C Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) whose recommendation finally pushed me to sign up and check it out.

I'm going to keep diary here of the concepts I'm exposed to each day. After I finish, I'll provide a **brief** writeup on my thoughts.

Hopefully this will be a good article for people who are curious about what the experience is like or working along and want to compare notes.

#### Day 1: JavaScript Drum Kit

Concepts:

- key events ([these](http://keycode.info/))
- Web Audio API ([this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API))
- Listener for ```trasitionend``` event (CSS transitions)

Thoughts:

That took more time than I'd have liked. I've never used the Web Audio API, so I had to read quite a bit to find the documentation for available methods. I like the way he snuck in ```el.classList``` property. That's a great jQuery alternative.

#### Day 2: CSS + JS Clock

Concepts:

- ```transform-origin``` (CSS)
- ```transition-timing-function``` (the easing curve can be shaped manually in Chrome DevTools!)
- ```setInterval()```
- ```Date()```

Thoughts:

Okay. This is a very well-designed course. I honestly learned more about CSS than JS with this one, because I've used the ```setInterval()``` and ```Date()``` plenty, but I've never used the transform and transition properties to achieve the effect of clock hands spinning.

Stay tuned...
