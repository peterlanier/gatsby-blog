What is a senior developer? Am I a senior developer? How do I become a senior developer? In [*The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap*](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap/), Andrei Neagoie seeks to answer these questions.

First I'll outline the scope of the course. It's pretty wide.

- SSH
- React & Redux
- Performance Optimization
- Testing
- TypeScript
- SPA vs. Server Side Rendering
- Security
- Code Analysis
- Docker
- Redis
- Sessions + JWT
- AWS
- CI/CD

Yeah.

Like I said, it's a wide scope for a course. However, it represents the typical tech stack for web developers in 2019. The industry is hiring people who can use these tools. But, how well does the course cover each subject?

To my surprise, Andrei does a fairly good job. He obviously put a lot of work into designing the course. His teaching style is not my favorite (I spent a fair amount of time watching him code), but it suffices.

Obviously, I would not recommend the course for someone interested in gaining a deeper knowledge of any of the individual parts: React, TypeScript, Docker, Redis, AWS, etc. But, that's not the point of the course anyway.

Andrei succeeds in teaching you the most popular tech stack, how it all fits together, and which tools you should consider adding to your arsenal if you haven't already. In this respect, the course lives up to its promise of being a rather nice roadmap.

There's no substitute for experience. And for those without experience, this is as good a place to start as any. I recommend it as a 10,000 foot overview of the modern web developer's tech stack.
