After watching and reviewing Anthony Alicea's timeless masterclass on JavaScript, I thought I should see what other courses he offered. So I picked up Learn and Understand NodeJS.

I'm not a Node developer per se, but as a JavaScript developer who relies heavily on NPM, I do use it daily in a sense. I had always wanted to learn more Node and had built simple servers with Express. I also use Node templates in AWS Lambda, so I knew I'd find plenty of applications for adding this new framework to my arsenal.

As with the previous course, things started clicking right away. I learned that Node was built on the V8 engine that powers Chrome. I had read that over the years, but Anthony reveals the concepts very well by walking through the C++ source code and explaining how the modules expose APIs to Node.

Next he provided a refresher on server theory and we built our own modules. I recognized many of the patterns we used from other Node apps and templates I've seen. He explained the difference between ES6 modules and Node modules as well as ES6 ```export``` and Node ```module.export```.

The course continues this way teaching you clearly and methodically all of the major concepts in Node:

- Events and Event Emitters
- The Event Loop
- Async Code
- Streams & Files
- Buffers and Pipes
- Routing
- Express
- Databases & JSON

Anthony Alicea is the most detail-oriented instructor that I've found. Unfortunately, the only course by him that I haven't picked up yet is on AngularJS from 2015 (before modern Angular 2+). I'll probably watch the Node and JS courses again just to reinforce the concepts and let it sink in better. His thought-process is truly unique and I strongly recommend this course for anyone wanting to learn and understand Node.
