I stumbled onto this course after seeing it recommended on Hacker News. I'm very glad I did because it's turned out to be not only the best course on JavaScript I've encountered, but also the best instructor.

JavaScript: Understading the Weird Parts is a thorough examination of JS, how it's written, parsed, compiled and run. Many of the concepts are basic and would otherwise be considered for novices if not for the brilliant teaching style of Tony Alicea. He explains concepts in such a methodical way that I found myself reviewing operators and operands just because he was presenting it in a way I'd never thought about.

At the time I watched this, I had at least 5 years of professional experience writing JavaScript. I've watched countless courses over the years. I suppose most instructors think people learn best by watching some dude code. Anthony teaches you how to think, how to learn, how to teach yourself.

Here are just a few of the concepts I came in with a vague knowledge of and came away with a penetrating clarity.

- Syntax Parser and Execution Context
- The Global Object
- Closures
- Prototypal Inheritance
- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions

I don't care how long you've been using JavaScript, you should definitely [give this a watch]('https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/').
