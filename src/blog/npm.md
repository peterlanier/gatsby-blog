Today GitHub (Microsoft) put the finishing touches on its acquisition of NPM. NPM is the repository and CLI toolchain for Node packages, which JavaScript developers have relied on for years.

So you might be wondering why a mega corporation like Microsoft has an interest in a JS package manager and a repository filled with a lot of useful packages... and a lot of uncurated garbage. At least that's my experience with NPM and I've been wondering that.

Here are my thoughts.

## Corporate Image: Open-Source Friendly 

Microsoft has always carefully nurtured its image as a friend to the open-source community. This was the case as far back as the war against Windows and Mac in the 90s, but even more recently with the acquisition of GitHub.

The perception of NPM will further legitimize the open-source friendly image that Microsoft would like to project.

## JavaScript Empire

Almost everyone who uses JavaScript uses NPM. And almost everyone who uses GitHub uses JavaScript ([sort of](https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2020/1)).

With so many other tools around JavaScript like Angular and TypeScript, it's apparent that Microsoft has been making investments in this language for quite a long time.

It makes sense that they would also acquire the most popular CLI tooling for the language.

## Tight Integration

Microsoft Azure has been growing aggressively since its inception in 2010. But most of the developers I know choose AWS for their project needs. By acquiring NPM, Azure can find new ways to integrate this tool with their cloud offering and perhaps convince developers that Azure is the choice for devs.

These are the 3 main reasons that come to my mind as developer. Doubtless, there are also many business reasons as well. Overall, I'm not too worried that Microsoft's aquisition will affect the quality of NPM, because GitHub has grown much better under their leadership.

And if they screw it all up, we still have Yarn.
